Scourge of the Past
 
Botza District
 
The objective is to deposit six “Radiant Batteries” in the nodes to unlock the shields guarding the sewer entrances
The encounter begins once the first node is charged
Enemies will spawn on the rooftops and throughout the area
A “Berserker, Kell’s Scourge” will spawn near the centre of the rooftops
When players get close to the Berserker it will spawn a suppression field around itself while charging a powerful attack
While charging its attack, two weak points will open on the Berserker’s chest and back allowing it to be neutralized
When the first Berserker is eliminated it will drop a Radiant Battery that is used to activate the node on top of the central building that powers a holographic map of the entire area
The green icons on the holographic map represent the location and number of the nodes, the yellow icons represent the location of players and the red icons represent the location of the Berserkers
An indicator located on the side of the holographic map projector will show the charge left in the central node, if the charge reaches 0 the team is killed
One of the Berserkers will have an orb over their icon, when eliminated that Berserker will drop two Radiant Batteries
When players pick up Radiant Batteries, they receive the “Unstable Reaction” debuff. They have 60 seconds to deposit the Radiant Battery before it kills them. The 60 second timer begins once the Radiant Battery drops not when it’s picked up
“Unhinged Servitors, Kell’s Scourge” will guard and block access to each node until they’re neutralized
Depositing a Radiant Battery at the correct node inflicts players with the “Ionized” debuff preventing them from picking up another Radiant Battery for 2:00 minutes
When a player picks up a Radiant Battery the map reader will see a series of dots appear above their icon indicating which node the player needs to deposit their Radiant Battery in
After the Radiant Batteries have been deposited the map reader will once again call out the positions of the next Berserkers
The encounter is complete once six Radiant Batteries are deposited at the nodes
Players can find the way to the next encounter at whichever node the last Radiant Battery was deposited in
The first chest is located underground near the entrance to the sewers

Botza Underground
 
Once access to the sewers is unlocked the team will need to navigate their way through the passageways and travel down the tunnel system until they reach a dead end
Two players will need to melee strike the terminals at the same time to unlock the door before fleeing the Servitor
Players can summon their sparrows and escape through the tunnels before reaching another door with two additional terminals that will lock out the Servitor when activated
Hidden throughout the tunnels are 8 red switches that when activated, turn green and open an additional door that leads to a secret chest
The team will then need to navigate their way through a jumping puzzle, cave and Black Armoury Vault before reaching the outdoor ruins
 
Botza Ruins
 
The objective is to break the shield mechanisms protecting “Insurrection Prime”
Enemies will spawn on the rooftops and throughout the ruins
Underneath the ruins is a circular passageway, players can access this area through the entrances beneath the ruined buildings
In the underground passageway there are four phase generators that hold three different types of “Phase Radiance” and another that holds a detonation switch that will kill the team if activated
The three different types of Phase Radiance are Continuous (Red), Angular (Blue) and Parallel (White)
The phase generator with the detonation switch will display all three Phase Radiances in rapid succession
Once collected players cannot collect Phase Radiance of a different type
The entranceways to the underground passageway are unlocked, and the phase generators are reset when the outside players neutralize the “Insurrection Defender, Kell’s Scourge” servitors
Players in the underground passageway will each need to collect two stacks of the same Phase Radiance before going back outside and depositing their Phase Radiance into any one of the three nodes in the area
Players carrying Phase Radiance of different types will receive the “Tethered” debuff and damage one another if they come too close to each other
Depositing two stacks of Phase Radiance in any of the three nodes will spawn a “Drake Tank” allowing players to damage the shield mechanisms protecting Insurrection Prime
The Drake Tanks will only last 28 seconds before self-destructing
Indicators located on the sides of the shield mechanisms protecting Insurrection Prime will show the charge left on a countdown sequence. If the charge reaches 0 the team is killed
The cycle continues until all four shield mechanisms protecting Insurrection Prime are destroyed
The second chest will spawn by the entrance to the ruins

Insurrection Prime
 
The objective is to remove Insurrection Prime’s shield and charge a phase generator to spawn a Drake Tank that is used to start the damage phase
A single Berserker will spawn near the ruins, once eliminated players can use the Radiant Battery to activate another holographic map
The encounter begins once the first node is charged
Enemies will spawn on the rooftops and throughout the ruins
The green icons on the holographic map represent the location and number of the nodes, the yellow icons represent the location of players and the red icons represent the location of the Berserkers
One of the Berserkers will have an orb over their icon, when eliminated that Berserker will drop two Radiant Batteries
When players get close to the Berserker it will spawn a suppression field around itself while charging a powerful attack
While charging its attack, two weak points will open on the Berserker’s chest and back allowing it to be neutralized
When players retrieve Radiant Batteries, they receive the Unstable Reaction debuff. They have 60 seconds to deposit the Radiant Battery before it kills them. The 60 second timer begins once the Radiant Battery spawns not when it’s picked up
Depositing a Radiant Battery at the correct node inflicts players with the Ionized debuff preventing them from picking up another Radiant Battery for 2:00 minutes
When a player picks up a Radiant Battery the map reader will see a series of dots appear above their icon indicating which node the player needs to deposit their Radiant Battery in
Insurrection Prime has multiple glowing weak points on it’s frame that when disabled, allow players to neutralize it’s weapon attacks
The team must deposit four Radiant Batteries in order to spawn the Drake Tank
A single shot from the Drake Tank will disable Insurrection Prime and begin the damage phase
Shortly after being disabled Insurrection Prime will release a burst of energy, each player will randomly receive one of the Phase Radiance types (Continuous, Angular or Parallel)
Players may need to change positions to match Phase Radiance types and avoid becoming Tethered and taking damage
Insurrection Prime will release multiple bursts of energy throughout the damage phase prompting players to change positions each time
The cycle repeats until Insurrection Prime is defeated
The final chest is located in the underground Black Armoury Vault
 
CHALLENGE MODE – “To Each Their Own”, players must not shoot and break more than one weak point on Insurrection Prime per damage phase!
