Sure, I can show you how to use these colors in your website design. Here are some mockups of how your website could look like with different color schemes:

- Black, Gold, Silver, and Red:

I hope these mockups give you some inspiration for your website design. You can use this website to create your own mockups: https://www.mockplus.com/ ðŸ˜Š



Sure, I can provide some example color codes for your color scheme. Here are some possible combinations:

- Black (#000000), Gold (#FFD700), Silver (#C0C0C0), and Red (#FF0000). This is a classic and elegant color scheme that conveys prestige and power.
- Black (#000000), Purple (#800080), Blue (#0000FF), and Green (#00FF00). This is a vibrant and dynamic color scheme that reflects the different elements and subclasses in Destiny 2.
- Black (#000000), Orange (#FFA500), Yellow (#FFFF00), and White (#FFFFFF). This is a bright and energetic color scheme that evokes the sun, fire, and light.

I hope these examples are helpful. You can use this website to generate more color schemes: https://coolors.co/ ðŸ˜Š
