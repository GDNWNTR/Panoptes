            Embrace
             
            The encounter begins once the team activates the conduit and chain’s the tether to the blocked barrier
            The team should split into two groups of three, one to stay behind and guard the Consecrated Mind and the other to push forward and unlock the next barrier
            The group guarding the Consecrated Mind should neutralize any enemies as well as “Quantum Cyclops” that spawn in the area
            The Consecrated Mind will spawn the “Voltaic Overflow” debuff
            The Voltaic Overflow debuff lasts 2:30 seconds and will wipe the entire team if it’s not collected immediately after it appears
            Players must wait through the full 2:30 second timer before they can collect Voltaic Overflow again
            The second group will make their way to the next barrier eliminating all the enemies that spawn including an “Overload Minotaur Champion”
            Once all enemies have been neutralized an “Angelic Hydra” will spawn, eliminating it will unlock a nearby conduit allowing the group to chain a tether and unlock the barrier
            Once the second group unlocks the barrier the Consecrated Mind will teleport to them and begin spawning Voltaic Overflows again
            At this point both groups should switch roles, with the first group now moving forward to neutralize the Overload Minotaur Champion, Quantum Cyclopes, Angelic Hydra and unlock the next barrier while the second group guards the Consecrated Mind and collects the Voltaic Overflow debuffs
            When the second barrier is opened the groups will switch roles again and move on to unlock the next set of barriers
            Once the team reaches the top of the plateau, they will need to eliminate six Quantum Cyclopes, three Overload Minotaur Champions and collect three Voltaic Overflow debuffs
            The first chest spawns on the back left side near the edge of the plateau
             
            CHALLENGE MODE – “Leftovers”, players guarding the Consecrated Mind cannot kill Quantum Cyclopes!
             
            Undergrowth
             
            The second chest is located inside the first inverted spire next to the large tree branch
            The second encounter begins once the Vex near the relay are neutralized
            The objective is to activate and defend four relays in the area
            The four relays are located at “Underbrush”, “Thicket”, “Hedges” and “Alcove” respectively
            At each location there will be an Angelic Hydra and two Barrier Hobgoblin Champions that need to be neutralized to unlock the relays
            Once unlocked, players can tether the conduits to the relays and gain the “Enlightened” buff which lasts for 45 seconds and allows them to damage any Vex with white shields
            Once each relay is unlocked players can use the teleporters to travel quickly between each relay
            The team will need two players to travel back and forth between the relays to help refresh the group’s Enlightened buffs and defend the relays
            Throughout the encounter groups of three Angelic Hydras will randomly spawn at each relay
            Once all four groups of Angelic Hydras are defeated the barriers blocking the middle section “Pavilion” will open
            The team should proceed to tether the conduit to the relay, gain the Enlightened buff and defend the final relay
            The third chest spawns near the final relay
             
            CHALLENGE MODE – “A Link to the Chain”, all players must refresh their Enlightened buff at the same time!
            
            Pavilion
             
            The encounter begins once the team tethers the conduit to the relay
            The objective is to collect and deposit thirty “Voltaic Motes”, defend the relays and collect the Voltaic Overflow debuffs
            Once the Consecrated Mind spawns, one of the relays in the area (Underbrush, Thicket, Hedges or Alcove) will light up sending a beam of light into the air indicating that it is active
            The team should split into two groups of three, one to guard the Consecrated Mind and defend the relay, the other to collect and deposit the Voltaic Motes
            Minotaurs will spawn near the Pavilion relay and drop five Voltaic Motes when neutralized
            One player should collect the Voltaic Motes and deposit them at the active relay, when depositing motes players receive the Enlightened buff
            The group collecting Voltaic Motes should wait for the next Minotaur to spawn
            Enemies including explosive Supplicant Harpies will spawn between the relays and attack players
            The Consecrated Mind will move around the area and spawn Voltaic Overflow debuffs however, when players collect them they will be detained
            While detaining a player the Consecrated Mind will open it’s fins and tendrils revealing six illuminated red lights (three outer and three inner)
            The detained player will only see three illuminated red lights and should communicate with the other players which of the lights are illuminated red (inner or outer) and disable only the illuminated red lights
            The damage phase begins once the team has deposited thirty Voltaic Motes and the Consecrated Mind moves to the active relay
            Once the Consecrated Mind reaches the active relay it will open it’s fins and tendrils revealing a number of illuminated red lights, the team should disable all the illuminated red lights before it’s centre eye turns white
            When the Consecrated Mind returns to the centre relay it will be immune. Another relay will activate and begin the cycle again until the Consecrated Mind is defeated!
            The fourth chest spawns in the corridor leading to the next encounter
             
            CHALLENGE MODE – “To the Top”, players must deposit ten Voltaic Motes at the active relay each time!
             
            Boundless Horizon
             
            The fifth chest is located inside a hollow tree trunk near the jumping puzzle
            Damaging the Sanctified Mind will begin the final encounter
            The team should split into two groups of three
            The objective is to deposit sixty Voltaic Motes (thirty on the Light side relay and thirty on the Dark side relay)
            Enemies will spawn near the Sanctified Mind, once the Angelic Hydra is neutralized two illuminated red lights will appear on the Sanctified Mind (on it’s hip and shoulder)
            Disabling the illuminated red light on it’s hip will open a blue portal to a plateau where players can neutralize enemies and collect Voltaic Motes
            Disabling the illuminated red light on it’s shoulder will open an orange portal to a plateau where players can neutralize enemies and collect Voltaic Motes
            Opening a portal will also spawn a Quantum Cyclops on the respective side
            Players on the plateaus will be automatically teleported back when the same illuminated red light on the Sanctified Mind is disabled
            The Sanctified Mind will also de-spawn sections of the ground near the Light and Dark relays whenever players are teleported to or from the plateaus
            The team can respawn lost sections of the ground by tethering one of the nearby conduits to the nearest active relay
            Players returning from the plateaus can deposit their Voltaic Motes at the Light or Dark relays to receive the Enlightened buff
            Once the first player on each side collects Voltaic Motes and returns from the plateau the next player in each group can go through the portal
            Once each group has deposited thirty Voltaic Motes the relays will pulse with energy starting the damage phase
            Another Angelic Hydra will spawn with more enemies
            A Light or Dark energy pulse will spawn near the Sanctified Mind indicating which relay the team should tether to the energy pulse
            Once the team tethers the correct relay to the energy pulse it will stun the Sanctified Mind and begin the damage phase
            Afterwards the Sanctified Mind will begin to rise into the air and spawn the other energy pulse, the team will once again need to tether the other relay to the energy pulse to extend the damage phase
            The encounter repeats until the Sanctified Mind is defeated!
             
            CHALLENGE MODE – “Zero to One Hundred”, all thirty motes must be deposited at the relays within 10 seconds!
